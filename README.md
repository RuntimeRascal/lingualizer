> make sure that you are in the project root directory when calling into the cli. this directory will be searched recursively for a folder called `localization` and will work with files directly in this directory.

Getting started

1. first create a folder named `localization` in your project's root.
2. now create a file called `<translations|projectFolderName>.json` for default culture or `<translations|projectFolderName>.es-mx.json` for a translated file.
